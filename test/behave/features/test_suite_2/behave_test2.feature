Feature: Please Integration with Behave - Test Feature 2
  In order to support BDD in python
  As the most awesome build tool
  I want to be able to support behave
  This is a feature for testing please integration with behave

  Scenario: Run a dummy test
    Given we have behave installed
    And  we should see our custom flags in context
    And behave finds 3 feature files
    When we implement 6 tests
    Then behave will test them for us!
