Version 2.0.0
-------------
    * Use Please v17.24.2's `pleasew` script, which downloads the correct Please binary for linux_arm64 (#279)
    * Implement run-time Python interpreter searching (#284)
      The new `DefaultRuntimeInterpreters` plugin configuration option (and `runtime_interpreters` parameter for
      `python_binary` and `python_test`) can be used to control which Python interpreters the .pex file attempts to execute
      when it runs itself.
    * Remove `InterpreterOptions` plugin configuration option (#288)
    * Upgrade pytest to 9.0.1 (#285)

    Breaking changes:

    * .pex files generated by this plugin are now prepended by a native-code binary rather than a shell script. This entirely
      removes .pex files' run-time dependency on `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/env`, but does now require them to be executed on
      the same platform on which they were built, even if they only contain pure Python.
    * The `InterpreterOptions` plugin configuration option has been removed in favour of the `DefaultRuntimeInterpreterArgs`
      plugin configuration option and the `runtime_interpreter_args` parameter for `python_binary` and `python_test`.
    * The `shebang` parameter for `python_binary` and `python_test` has been removed. Equivalent functionality is now
      provided by `DefaultRuntimeInterpreterArgs` and `runtime_interpreter_args` (see above).
	* pytest has been upgraded from 7.4.2 to 9.0.1 in the built-in pytest test runner. There are breaking changes between
      these versions; see [pytest's changelog](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html) for details.
